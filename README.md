### Explanations of specific Technologies 
The Go Fish game is wrirten in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is ran in a web browser.

### Approach Taken
My approach was to first make a wireframe of the layout of the game. Then, I started coding functions to deal cards to each player. Eventually I added functions for requesting cards from players, drawing a single card from the deck, checking if the player is out of cards, and determining when a player scores points. 

I used the APIs at https://deckofcardsapi.com/ to shuffle the deck of cards and retrieve cards from the deck. I also used the card images from the API in my HTML template.

### Unsolved Problems
The game currently cannot detect when the game is over.
