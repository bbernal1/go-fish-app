# Go Fish Game
### Wireframe
https://wireframe.cc/dACiw4

### Explanations of specific Technologies 
The Go Fish game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game runs in a web browser.

### Approach Taken
I first made a wireframe of the layout of the game and then wrote the HTML and CSS based on the wireframe. Then, I started coding functions to deal cards to each player. Eventually I added functions for requesting cards from players, drawing a single card from the deck, checking if the player is out of cards, and determining when a player scores points. I used the APIs at https://deckofcardsapi.com/ to shuffle the deck of cards and retrieve cards from the deck. I also used the card images from the API in my HTML template.

### Unsolved Problems
The application cannot detect when the game ends. The CSS needs to cleaned up. The player 1 and 2 card count box needs to be put into an HTML table.
